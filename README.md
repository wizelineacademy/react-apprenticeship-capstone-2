# React Intermediate Challenge 2 - Styles, Fetching API, Testing.

## Overview
For this challenge, you will create an awesome React App which fetches the "Picture of the day" from the NASA open `APOD API`.
> **Tip**: Set up ESLint and Prettier.

- **Goal**: Create an app from scratch, consider your best UX knowledge for the UI design; it is up to you.
- **Recommendations**: Consider the following elements that should contain the app:
  - Title
  - Date Picker
  - Main section with the image

### Requisites

Consider the following when developing the app:
  - Don't use UI Libraries. You have to build your styles. You can use styled components such as SASS, LESS, or CSS. You are free to use the approach that makes sense to you.
  - Fetch API Calls from the `NASA APOD` using your API KEY.
  - Publish your app using free services such as Github pages, Netflify, or Heroku. 
  - Share the URL on the PR.
  - Use the React Testing Library and Jest tools to add tests.
  - Use functional components and React Hooks as possible.
- **Resources**: [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)
