    "explanation": "What's happening over the horizon?  Although the scene may appear somehow supernatural, nothing more unusual is occurring than a setting Sun and some well placed clouds.  Pictured above are anticrepuscular rays.  To understand them, start by picturing common crepuscular rays that are seen any time that sunlight pours though scattered clouds. Now although sunlight indeed travels along straight lines, the projections of these lines onto the spherical sky are great circles.  Therefore, the crepuscular rays from a setting (or rising) sun will appear to re-converge on the other side of the sky.  At the anti-solar point 180 degrees around from the Sun, they are referred to as anticrepuscular rays.  Featured here is a particularly striking display of anticrepuscular rays photographed earlier this month in Westminster, Colorado, USA.   Deja vu: Anticrepuscular Rays over Colorado (I)",

    "explanation": "About three million years ago, the stars in the Keyhole Nebula began to form.  The above picture of the Keyhole Nebula, also known as the Carina Nebula or NGC 3372, shows in infrared light many facets of this dramatic stellar nursery which lies only 9,000 light-years away.  Fine dust reflects starlight while being heated and emitting light of its own.  Open clusters Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 are visible in the lower left and upper right of the nebula.  The bright star near Trumpler 14 is called Eta Carinae and is one of the most unusual stars known.  A candidate for a supernova in the next few thousand years, Eta Carinae faded from being one of the brightest stars in the sky during the 1800s.  Despite intensive study, astronomers remain unsure whether Eta Carinae is part of a binary star system.",

    "explanation": "There are more bacteriophages on Earth than any other life-like form.  These small viruses are not clearly a form of life, since when not attached to bacteria they are completely dormant.  Bacteriophages attack and eat bacteria and have likely been doing so for over 3 billion years ago.  Although initially discovered early last century, the tremendous abundance of phages was realized more recently when it was found that a single drop of common seawater typically contains millions of them.  Extrapolating, phages are likely to be at least a billion billion (sic) times more numerous than humans. Pictured above is an electron micrograph of over a dozen bacteriophages attached to a single bacterium.  Phages are very small -- it would take about a million of them laid end-to-end to span even one millimeter.  The ability to kill bacteria makes phages a potential ally against bacteria that cause human disease, although bacteriophages are not yet well enough understood to be in wide spread medical use.   digg_url = 'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080421.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';",

    "explanation": "Faint comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) sweeps past background stars in the constellation Taurus and even fainter distant galaxies in this telescopic frame from September 7. About 5 years ago, this comet's 4 kilometer spanning, double-lobed nucleus became the final resting place of robots from planet Earth, following the completion of the historic Rosetta mission to the comet. After wandering out beyond the orbit of Jupiter, Churyumov-Gerasimenko is now returning along its 6.4 year periodic orbit toward its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun, on November 2. On November 12, the comet's perigee, its closest approach to Earth, will bring it within about 0.42 astronomical units. Telescopes should still be required to view it even at its brightest, predicted to be in late November and December. On September 7 Rosetta's comet was about 0.65 astronomical units away or about 5.4 light-minutes from our fair planet.",

    "explanation": "Venus, Mercury, and Saturn wandered close together in western evening skies last week. On Saturnday, June 25, astronomer R. Jay GaBany recorded this snapshot of their eye-catching planetary conjunction, from historic Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, California, USA. The view looks toward the Pacific shortly after sunset with the lights of San Jose and the southern San Francisco Bay area in the foreground. Of course, Venus is the brightest of the trio. Mercury is nearby on the right and Saturn is below and left, closest to the horizon. Farther to the right of the planetary triangle are Pollux and Castor, twin stars of Gemini, with Regulus, bright star of the constellation Leo, at the very upper left corner of the picture. In the coming days, Venus and Mercury remain close, while Saturn continues to drop below them, toward the horizon.",

    "explanation": "Are any volcanoes on Io currently erupting?\r To help answer this, scientists instructed the robot spacecraft Galileo\r to take hourly pictures of this moon\r of Jupiter prior to its most recent\r encounter. The most obvious changes in Io are due to the changing\r amount of sunlight reflected from the moon to the spacecraft.\r More careful inspection does verify continuous volcanic plumes.\r The most prominent plume visible is from Prometheus, visible\r just below Io's\r equator. This plume was first photographed in 1979 by Voyager,\r so Prometheus appears to have been erupting continuously for at\r least 18 years! On most browsers, the above picture will appear\r animated.

    "explanation": "Majestic on a truly cosmic scale, M100 is appropriately known as a Grand Design spiral galaxy. A large galaxy of over 100 billion or so stars with well defined spiral arms, it is similar to our own Milky Way. One of the brightest members of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies , M100 (alias NGC 4321) is 56 million light-years distant in the spring constellation of Coma Berenices. This Hubble Space Telescope image of the central region of M100 was made in 1993 with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. It reveals the bright blue star clusters and intricate winding dust lanes which are hallmarks of this class of galaxies. Studies of stars in M100 have recently played an important role in determining the size and age of the Universe.",

    "explanation": "What's that passing in front of the Sun? It looks like a moon, but it can't be Earth's Moon, because it isn't round. It's the Martian moon Phobos.  The featured video was taken from the surface of Mars late last month by the Curiosity rover. Phobos, at 11.5 kilometers across, is 150 times smaller than Luna (our moon) in diameter, but also 50 times closer to its parent planet.  In fact, Phobos is so close to Mars that it is expected to break up and crash into Mars within the next 50 million years.  In the near term, the low orbit of Phobos results in more rapid solar eclipses than seen from Earth. The featured video has been sped up -- the actual transit took about 35 seconds. A similar video was taken of Mars' smaller and most distant moon Diemos transiting the Sun.  The videographer -- the robotic rover Curiosity -- continues to explore Gale crater, most recently an area with stunning vistas and unusual rocks dubbed Glen Torridon.

    "explanation": "An eerie blue glow and ominous columns of dark dust highlight M78 and other bright reflection nebula in the constellation of Orion.  The dark filamentary dust not only absorbs light, but also reflects the light of several bright blue stars that formed recently in the nebula.  Of the two reflection nebulas pictured above, the more famous nebula is M78, in the image center, while NGC 2071 can be seen to its lower left. The same type of scattering that colors the daytime sky further enhances the blue color.  M78 is about five light-years across and visible through a small telescope.  M78 appears above only as it was 1600 years ago, however, because that is how long it takes light to go from there to here.  M78 belongs to the larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex that contains the Great Nebula in Orion and the Horsehead Nebula.   Follow APOD on: Facebook,  Google Plus, or Twitter",

    "explanation": "What caused this unusual light rock formation on Mars?  Intrigued by the possibility that they could be salt deposits left over as an ancient lakebed dried-up, detailed studies of these fingers now indicate a more mundane possibility: volcanic ash.  Studying the exact color of the formation indicated the possible volcanic origin.  The light material appears to have eroded away from surrounding area, indicating a very low-density substance. The stark contrast between the rocks and the surrounding sand is compounded by the unusual darkness of the sand.  The featured picture was taken with the Thermal Emission Imaging System on the Mars Odyssey, the longest serving  spacecraft currently orbiting Mars.  The image spans about 10 kilometers inside a larger crater.",
